# Behind Trump's Tweets

## Introduction

Describe the dataset and what we did. Goals, method, and so on.  
Pretty much rewrite some stuff from the project plan.

## General Exploration

As a starting point for the general exploration, let us take a look at Trump's total tweets per month has changed since he started tweeting in the middle of year 2009.

Right away we see an (at least for us) rather suprising result. The total tweets per month were not at their highest levels during Trump's presidential campaign, June 16, 2015 to November 9, 2016. Note the sharp decline in tweets right after the election. This lower tweet frequency has remained though Trump's presidency.

The latest data was acquired in the middle of a November, thus the total for November 2017 is relatively low.

### Distribution by hour of day

Continuing on with our general exploration, we now look at in what hour of the day Trump's tweets are posted (using the entire dataset from 2009 to present).
